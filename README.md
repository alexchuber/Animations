# Animation-Project
I made this as part of my digital arts & sciences class (CAP3027). To animate an object, we
linearly interpolated between the objects' vertex positions from one keyframe to the next.

This project was made with Processing, a free graphical library and IDE that uses Java.  Be sure to rename the root folder to Project6 if you'd like to run it for yourself.
